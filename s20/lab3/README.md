# Lab 3: CS 220/301 Review and Complexity

Start a new notebook on your virtual machine, then complete the following three parts of the lab:

1. review [files and JSON](part1.md) -- this should help a lot with P1 if you're rusty with those concepts
2. visualize [orders of growth](part2.md) -- get an intuition for what N and C mean
3. learn [merge sort](part3.md) -- this is an important algorithm for sorting lists that has complexity between O(N) and O(N**2)

Have fun, and let us know if you have any questions!
