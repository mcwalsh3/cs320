      <h1>Understanding the Numbers</h1>
      <p>For each state, we collected three data frames: average temperature, average precipitation, and PDSI. Each dataframe has three columns: date, value, and anomaly.</p>
      <p><ins>Date</ins>: Year between 1981-2010 when data was recorded</p>
      <p><ins>Value</ins>: Value of main statistic in each respective dataframe:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">-<b>Average Temperature</b> = Average temperature recorded in the state per year (Fahrenheit)</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">-<b>Average Precipitation</b> = Average amount of precipitation in the state per year (inches)</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">-<b>PDSI</b> = Palmer Drought Severity Index, an index that estimates relative dryness (ranges from -10 to 10)</p>
      <p><ins>Anomoly</ins>: A value's distance from its respective mean</p>
      <p><ins>Song Sparrow Population</ins>: 
      
      <p>For this project we chose to evaluate ecological factors that we thought would have an effect on bird population yearly in the United States. This data was collected by citizen scientists as well as meteorological instruments called Automated Weather Observing Systems set up at stations across each state from years 1981-2010. These stations recorded the following statistics:</p>
      <p><ins>State</ins>: U.S. state where station(s) is/are located</p>
      <p><ins>Latitude</ins>: Latitudinal measurement of each station</p>
      <p><ins>Longitude</ins>: Longitudinal measurement of each station</p>
      <p><ins>Elevation</ins>: Height of the station measured from sea level in meters (m)</p>
      <p><ins>AnnualPrecip</ins>: Average amount of precipitation at a given station per year (in)</p>
      <p><ins>AnnualSnow</ins>: Average amount of snowfall at a given station per year (in)</p>
      <p><ins>DailyMinTemp</ins>: Average minimum temperature reached each day per year (Fahrenheit)</p>
      <p><ins>DailyMaxTemp</ins>: Average maximum temperature reached each day per year (Fahrenheit)</p>
      <p><ins>DailyAvgTemp</ins>: Average temperature over each day per year (Fahrenheit)</p>
